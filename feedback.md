# Feedback for Student

Based on the Autograder Output and Professor Instructions, here are some guided questions and suggestions for each student code:

**time_conversion.c**

1. The Autograder output shows a warning about an implicit declaration of the `atoi` function. This is because the `atoi` function is declared in the `stdio.h` header file, but it's not included in your code.
   - Make sure to include the necessary header files at the top of your code.

2. The Autograder output also shows another warning about an implicit declaration of a function. However, this one is more critical and should be fixed first.
   - Look for the line where `hours` and `minutes` are calculated and make sure the variable declarations are correct.

3. Your program seems to work correctly for some inputs, but not all. Make sure to test your code thoroughly with different inputs.

**product.c**

1. The Autograder output shows two errors related to the declaration of the `product` variable.
   - Move the line `int product = 1;` above the `for` loop where it's being used.

2. Another error is that the `product` variable is not declared before it's being used in the `fscanf` function.
   - Declare the `product` variable at the top of your code, along with the other variables.

3. The Autograder output also shows an error about a file not existing. This is likely because the test script can't find the output file generated by your program.
   - Make sure that the output file is being generated correctly and that the path to it is correct in the test script.

4. Your program seems to work correctly for some inputs, but not all. Make sure to test your code thoroughly with different inputs.

**General Suggestions**

1. Review your code thoroughly to catch any other errors or warnings.
2. Make sure to include necessary header files and declare variables before they're used.
3. Test your code thoroughly with different inputs to ensure it's working correctly.
4. Check the output of your program to make sure it matches the expected results.
